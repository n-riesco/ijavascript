## Code contributions

- Please, open an issue in the [issue
  tracker](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/issues).

- Pull requests will be distributed under the terms in the LICENSE file. Hence,
  before accepting any pull requests, it is important that the copyright holder
  of a pull request acknowledges their consent. To express this consent, please,
  ensure the AUTHORS file has been updated accordingly.

- New functionalities should be documented, for this you can create tutorials as
  markdown or ipython notebook format in the folder `doc/md` or `doc/ipynb`.
  Then add a link to this tutorial in the `_navbar.tpl` jinja template and
  regenerate the doc with `npm run doc` to see the result.

## Coding guidelines

- For the sake of readability, please, ensure the coding style of your pull
  requests is consistent with this project: lowerCamelCaseNaming,
  CONSTANTS_NAMING, 4-space indent, collapsed brackets...

- The IPython protocol uses underscores (`_`) in their the naming convention (as
  recommended in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)). For these
  names, I find more readable to keep the original naming (although, if possible
  limited to a local scope).

- The source code in IJavascript is annotated using
  [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc). The generated documentation can be
  found [here](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/tree/master/doc/jsdoc).
